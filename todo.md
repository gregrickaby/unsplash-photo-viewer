# Display photos from Unsplash

## To Do

1. Set connection variables in an ENV file âœ…
2. Create connector partial that sets up a request âœ…
3. Create a fetcher with useSWR or Axios âœ…
4. Lazy load the first 9 images in a masonry grid âœ…
5. Using a button, lazy load the next images âœ…
6. Create single page for each image, which includes all the details âœ…
7. Display tags as facet, clicking a facet will filter the photos
8. Use TailwindCSS + CSS Modules for styles âœ…
9. Offer dark mode âœ…

## Issues

1. I need client-side data fetching and to move Unsplash creds into NEXT*PUBLIC* env vars.
2. Needed to use SSR on single photo page, because the Unsplash API would fail during build time ðŸ˜¡

## Notes

- Unsplash will only ever return a max of 30 photos.
